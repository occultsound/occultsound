# occultsou​nd

I explore consciousness, symbolism, and structure —  
usually by thinking too much about how things are put together.

My work is rooted in Western esotericism and symbolic systems.  
I am a published author and teacher, curious about how meaning, awareness,  
and boundaries emerge — in thought, experience, and occasionally, in systems.  
Based in Taiwan.

Technology is not my destination, but I enjoy using it  
to make abstract thinking slightly more tangible.

## Focus

- Western esotericism & symbolic systems  
- Consciousness and non-dual inquiry  
- Structural thinking (boundaries, layers, sets)  
- Writing, teaching, and knowledge transmission  
- Homelab experiments and self-hosted curiosities  
- Networks, observability, and why systems behave the way they do

## About this GitHub

Repositories here are mostly:

- experiments and half-finished ideas  
- notes that accidentally became code  
- small tools built to support writing, teaching, and research  
- explorations driven by curiosity rather than efficiency  

This is not a portfolio,  
but a thinking space where ideas sometimes compile.

## Elsewhere

Most of my actual work happens outside GitHub —  
in books, teaching, and long-form thinking.

This space quietly supports that work.
